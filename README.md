# Advent of Code

This repository contains the solutions I've written for advent of code. I just do it for fun; I don't try too hard to write them as quickly as possible or anything (not that I'm cut out for speed coding anyway). I write them in Python because it's easy; maybe one of these years I'll do another language. When working on part 2 for a particular day, I try to retain a working solution for part 1 as well (which tends to be reasonably easy w/ how the problems are designed), so for any completed solution in this repository there should be working code for both part 1 and part 2.

- **2022** - I got stuck on the day 19 problems and then got caught up in the holidays, so there are solutions up to day 19 and an incomplete solution for day 19.
